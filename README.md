  # Reflection
   
  Making my personal portfolio website was both challenging and enjoyable because it allowed me to apply simple UI/UX principles in practice. At first, I had some struggles with the navigation part. The links worked, but the transition was too fast and not smooth that i cant even find it better to see. I solved this problem by adding a small JavaScript code for smooth scrolling , which made the user experience better and more comfortable. I also faced challenges in arranging the layout for the “Skills” and “Activities” sections. They did not look neat in the beginning, but by using CSS Flexbox and grid, I was able to align them properly and make the design more organized.

     In designing the site, I applied visual hierarchy by using headings and different font sizes for each section so users can easily see the important parts. The navigation bar was set to be fixed on top so visitors can always move easily to other sections. I also made sure that the portfolio is responsive, which means it can be opened on phones, tablets, or laptops without breaking the layout. For readability, I used a simple sans-serif font, clear spacing, and light text on a dark background so it is easy on the eyes. I added call-to-action buttons like “View” in the Home section and “Send Message” in the Contact section. These buttons guide users on what action to take. The design is simple, not too crowded, and focused only on the important details about me.

      In the future, I want to improve this project by adding more creative features such as animations, other effects, and a better presentation of my activities and projects. This will make the portfolio more interactive while keeping it simple and user-friendly.
